# Write the function setKthDigit(n, k, d) that takes three integers -- n, k, and d 
# where n is a possibly-negative int, k is a non-negative int, and d is a non-negative 
# single digit (between 0 and 9 inclusive). This function returns the number n with 
# the kth digit replaced with d. Counting starts at 0 and goes right-to-left, 
# so the 0th digit is the rightmost digit.
